ChemCaption is a Python library that enables prompt generation for molecular features.
The library provides a collection of featurizers, designed to process molecules
and determine the desired features. These features can then be incorporated into 
prompts, providing question and answer pairs for every feature.

ChemCaption additionally provides an easy-to-use interface, allowing easy integration
and extension with additional featurizers.
